# Intersection of Two Arrays
<br>
The intersection of two sets is a subset which contains the elements which are members
of both of the given sets. The idea of using a HashMap is to improve effeciency as HashMaps
can perform insertions and lookups in O(N) time (given the proper circumstances).
<br>
A solution involving nested loops would have a time complexity of O(NÂ²) while this solution 
using a HashMap reduces the time complexity to O(N) where N is the sum of the lengths of the 
arrays to be compared (total number of elements).
